### Email_Spam_Classifier

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to classify emails as either spam or not spam. It involves cleaning the data, preprocessing it, and training a classifier to achieve accurate predictions.

# Project Overview

The objective of this project is to develop a robust spam classification model that can identify unsolicited emails effectively. This is achieved using a supervised learning approach with textual data from an email dataset.

# Features :

1. Data Preprocessing: Includes cleaning, normalization, and encoding of text data.

2. Model Training: Utilizes machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow to train the classification model.

3. Evaluation: Assesses the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.

# Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from a CSV file (spam.csv). It contains labeled email data with information about whether each email is spam. The dataset is downloaded from kaggle.

# Steps in the Notebook :

1. Data Loading: Reads the dataset and resolves encoding issues.

2. Data Cleaning: Removes noise, handles missing values, and prepares text for analysis.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzes the dataset's structure and visualizes patterns.

4. Feature Extraction: Converts text data into numerical representations using techniques like TF-IDF.

5. Model Training: Trains a classifier using TensorFlow and fine-tunes hyperparameters.

6. Model Evaluation: Evaluates the model's performance and visualizes results.
